# Introduction

Welcome to the exam template. This simple setup is meant to facilitate the exam.

There are two folders:
- `client`, containing the React and webpack configuration of the frontend;
- `server`, containing the .Net configuration of the backend.

The `client` project automatically creates the bundle files in `server/wwwwroot`.

In order to run the project just run `./startup.sh`, or, alternative, run:
- `yarn fe-watch` from the `client` directory;
- `dotnet watch run Project.csproj` from the `server` directory.


As always: you can do it, take a deep breath, stay centered, and good luck!!! 💪❤️
